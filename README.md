Aligned the existing content with the new design, implemented layout adjustments on vocabulary arrangement to make sure there is consistency across all pages. Plugin updates for WP security and removed the depreciated plugins.

### [x] week 2
Created and tested the 6 WordPress patterns to create styling easier in future using Prof. Bose design. Updated question structure page based on the design provided, which involved layout recreations and adjustments to headings, title bars, vocabulary sign arrangements. DB optimization to improve site performance especially when multiple gifs are loading in. The issue still persists especially on the phone and compression would make the gifs not pretty, so there needs to be another way.
### [x] TODO: Fix load GIFs 
> nov 5 // 11

### [x] week 3
Optimized GIFs to improve site performance, lazy loading is native to Wordpress but disabled on theme used, that is fixed now, and resolved text morphing issues at different aspect ratios. Created a main vocabulary page with two column lists and bullet points for navigation. This may look different at different aspect ratios so that will need to be dealt with. Can not use a page list as that has no styling attributes and can't not be split in two.  **List items must be manually added** and alphabetic. Backup and site analytics to track performance metrics.

### [x] week 4
Fixed spacing issues above GIFs, created additional grammar pages from previous lesson, fixed design patterns based on the feedback. Developed new design patterns for GIF. Properly linked the lists as there were many missing **not a bug**. Make the 12 pages consistent with the design patterns and all use the 7 patterns now. Based on feedback, I made several adjustments to the patterns and layouts as well as reorganizing content structures.

### [x] week 5
Restored previous pattern versions using the 2 sentences on the 6 latest lessons. testing and implementing new video patterns, adjusting new pattern layouts to accommodate video content, and applied CSS adjustments to enhance video layouts. I looked into CSS solutions for the video pattern but that route should go through JS. Submitted ticket to WordPress on the limitations with video pattern overrides. There is a possibility to reuse video patterns like we did with the exercise, however code blocks are not overridden as well. There are no plugins to change this. JS on all videopres instances seems to be a viable solution. Still testing to make sure all updates with the JS were implemented fine and still maintained optimal site performance.
